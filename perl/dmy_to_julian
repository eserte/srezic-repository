# here is a DCL version of the R.G. Tantzen algorithm ('ALGORITHM 199' of
# the 'Association for Computing Machinery' (ACM)) that convert gregorian
# date to julian day number and back. all is integer arithmetic and 32-bit
# integers.
#
# this algorithm is year-2000-proof, leap-year-proof, century-leap-year-proof
# and you can compute julian day with this algorithm back to the begining of
# the gregorian calendar, october 15, 1582.
