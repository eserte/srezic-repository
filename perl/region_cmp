=head2 region_cmp($a1,$a2,$b1,$b2)

=for category Misc

Compares two one-dimensional regions. The regions are specified by the
start and end coordinates. The results are:

=over 4

=item before

The first region is completely before the second region.

=item after

The first region is completely after the second region.

=item equals

The both regions are equal.

=item in

The first region is completely in the second region.

=item overlaps

The second region is completely in the first region.

=item overlaps_before

The two regions overlap partly, the first region starts before the
second one.

=item overlaps_after

The two regions overlap partly, the first region ends after the
second one.
