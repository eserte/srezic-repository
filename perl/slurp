=head2 slurp($file)

=for category File

Return content of the file I<$file>. Die if the file is not readable.

An alternative implementation would be

    sub slurp ($) { open my $fh, shift or die $!; local $/; <$fh> }

but this probably won't work with very old perls.

=cut

sub slurp ($) {
    my($file) = @_;
    my $fh;
    my $buf;
    open $fh, $file
	or die "Can't slurp file $file: $!";
    local $/ = undef;
    $buf = <$fh>;
    close $fh;
    $buf;
}
